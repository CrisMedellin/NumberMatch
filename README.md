# Number Match Game

This project is an implementation of the mobile game "Number Match." In this game, players match numbers to eliminate them from the board. The project includes the basic game functionalities and a "Solver" feature, which automatically solves the game with the fewest possible moves.

## Features
- **Basic Game Mechanics**: Match identical numbers or numbers that sum up to 10 to clear them from the board.
- **Multiple Matching Options**: Match numbers horizontally, vertically, diagonally, or from the end of one row to the beginning of another.
- **Solver Function**: An automatic solver that finds the optimal solution with the least number of moves.

## How to Play
1. Start the game and a grid filled with numbers will be displayed.
2. Select pairs of numbers that are either identical or add up to 10 to eliminate them.
3. The goal is to clear the entire board.
